There are 486 data files.
  
The problem in each data file have an associated notation as follows:
  
3-50-10-55-20: denotes that this is the 3rd instance  
			in a group of problems  
			with 10-dimensions, 100-items and  
			the max 30%-uncertainty on profit intervals.  

The \mbox{MMR-KP} instances are denoted by 'v-ww-xx-yy-zz,' where $v=\textrm{type}$, $ww=n$, $xx=\bar{R}/1000$, $yy=100\gamma$, and $zz=100\delta$.

The format for each of these data files is:
~~~
number of dimensions (m)	number of items (n)
the minimum profit of item j (j=1,...,n)
the maximum profit of item j (j=1,...,n)
for each dimension i (i=1,...,m) in turn:
    resource consumed in selecting item j in dimension i (j=1,...,n)
resource capacity of dimension i (i=1,...,m)
~~~

There are 270 data files.
  
The problem in each data file have an associated notation as follows:

## MMR-GAP instance format

There are 300 data files and 60 files for each type.
  
The problem in each data file have an associated notation as follows:
  
 c054025-3.dat:	denotes that this is the 3rd instance  
		in a group of problems of type c  
		with 5-agents, 40-jobs and  
		the max 25%-uncertainty on cost intervals.

The format for each of these data files is:
~~~
number of agents (m)
number of jobs (n)
for each agent i (i=1,...,m) in turn:
    the minimum cost of allocating job j to agent i (j=1,...,n)
for each agent i (i=1,...,m) in turn:
    the maximum cost of allocating job j to agent i (j=1,...,n)
for each agent i (i=1,...,m) in turn:
    resource consumed in allocating job j to agent i (j=1,...,n)
resource capacity of agent i (i=1,...,m)
